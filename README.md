# ListMaker-version-one
This is a small program I made for friend that wanted to combined two list of words to have every possible combination of those two lists without any repeats.  To use put the lists that you wish to combined in the same folder as the listMaker.py and name one list listAey.txt and the second list name listBii.txt. it should produce a new txt file with your two list comined saved to the same folder.

In list maker version two I have incorprated and NLTK so that you can choose types of speech like nouns or verbs from the list and no others. Which will be posted if requested.
